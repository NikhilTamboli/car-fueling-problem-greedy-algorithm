Problem Introduction
You are going to travel to another city that is located 𝑑 miles away from your home city. Your car can travel
at most 𝑚 miles on a full tank and you start with a full tank. Along your way, there are gas stations at
distances stop1,stop2, . . . ,stop𝑛 from your home city. What is the minimum number of refills needed?

Problem Description
Input Format-> The first line contains an integer 𝑑. The second line contains an integer 𝑚. The third line
specifies an integer 𝑛. Finally, the last line contains integers stop1,stop2, . . . ,stop𝑛.

Output Format-> Assuming that the distance between the cities is 𝑑 miles, a car can travel at most 𝑚 miles
on a full tank, and there are gas stations at distances stop1,stop2, . . . ,stop𝑛 along the way, output the
minimum number of refills needed. Assume that the car starts with a full tank. If it is not possible to
reach the destination, output −1.

Constraints-> 1 ≤ 𝑑 ≤ 105. 1 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 400. 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 300. 0 < stop1 < stop2 < · · · < stop𝑛 < 𝑑.
